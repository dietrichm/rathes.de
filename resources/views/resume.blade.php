                        It took me quite a while to realize that it's better to be a specialist instead of a generalist. On the other side I'm interested in many aspects of tech and web.

                    <p>
                        In 2014 I shifted more towards PHP with Laravel and JavaScript (ES2015+) with Vue and React. That's my specialization as a developer.

                    <p>
                        Additionally I am focused on the aspect of requirements engineering. My bachelor thesis at university was about goal driven requirements engineering. I adopted this method to use it for the whole aspect of running a business to make it profitable as soon as possible.

                    <p>
                        Last but not least, I read a lot about AI and Machine Learning. I'm not that far that I would call me pro in this field, but it is a goal to get more into the field.

                    I started working as a professional web designer and web developer at very young ages. When I was 14 I had my first client jobs and in 2008, at the age of 16, I founded my first own company for web design and development. Since then I have worked with several clients doing quite a wide range of tasks.
                <br><br>
                    After my BSc. in Computer Science in 2014, I decided to set my main focus more on developments and spend only little on design. Now I'm mainly working as a web developer on Laravel (PHP), Vue and React (JavaScript) projects.

                        In summer 2018 I started a new chapter and joined Teamleader. This is not only a great opportunity for me to grow as a developer, but also a big new adventure as I am moving to a new city in a new country with a language I still have to learn.

                        While I was working most of my time as a Freelancer, in 2016 I decided decrease client work and focus more on creating own products. Therefore I changed the type of my business and created a custom brand for this company.
