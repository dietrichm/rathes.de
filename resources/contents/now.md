title: Now
---

This page will tell you what I am focussed on at this current point of my life. I will do my best to update it as often as my path changes. You can also use this page as some kind of replacement for the more personal "About me" page as it will reflect my hobbies and interests. If you check out the history of this content page on [GitHub](https://github.com/rathesDot/rathes.de), you can even follow how my interests change over the months.
