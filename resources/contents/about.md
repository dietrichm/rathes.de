## Work experience

I started working as a professional web designer and web developer at very young ages. When I was 14 I had my first client jobs and in 2008, at the age of 16, I founded my first own company for web design and development. Since then I have worked with several clients doing quite a wide range of tasks.

After my BSc. in Computer Science in 2014, I decided to set my main focus more on developments and spend only little on design. Now I'm mainly working as a web developer on Laravel (PHP), Vue and React (JavaScript) projects.

### Specialization

It took me quite a while to realize that it's better to be a specialist instead of a generalist. On the other side I'm interested in many aspects of tech and web.

In 2014 I shifted more towards **PHP with Laravel** and **JavaScript (ES2015+) with Vue and React**. That's my specialization as a developer.

Additionally I am focused on the aspect of requirements engineering. My bachelor thesis at university was about **goal driven requirements engineering**. I adopted this method to use it for the whole aspect of running a business to make it profitable as soon as possible.

Last but not least, I read a lot about **AI and Machine Learning**. I'm not that far that I would call me pro in this field, but it is a goal to get more into the field.
